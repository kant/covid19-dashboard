But the COVID-19 situation is changing quickly, and these models inevitably include some level of speculation. . Outstanding Cases by Geography . The chart below shows the total predicted number of outstanding cases, i.e. number of individuals who are still currently ill. . The chart also represents the reported case fatality rate (CFR) via the color of the country, which is heavily biased by the amount of testing which is performed in each country. .

Percent of Global Total . This next chart shows the number of outstanding cases as a percent of the total confirmed global cases. Only countries representing a significant contribution to global totals are shown. . Tip: Hover over chart areas for more details. . Appendix: Methodology of Predicting Recovered Cases . John Hopkin&#39;s University&#39;s (JHU) dataset initially reported recovered cases but has since discontinued this, however estimating the recovery duration and extrapolating for current cases should be possible from this original data. . For the time being (I hope to draw from other discussions of this topic), I will use an empirically derived formula from the limited data available from JHU: . $$R_{n} = R_{n-1} + (C_{n-9} - R_{n-1})*0.07$$ . Where $R_{n}$ is the total number of recovered cases on day $n$, and $C_{n}$ is the total number of confirmed cases on day $n$. . What it implies is that on a given day, of the cases which were first reported 9 days previously 7% of those cases would have either recovered or passed away. After 16 days therefore 49% of cases would have recovered or passed away and after 23 days 98% of cases would have recovered or passsed away. . This formula is only being used to predict the number of recoveries from the time that JHU&#39;s data is not available. We can compare the results of this formula to the existing data from JHU to show the level of fit. This can be seen in the following 2 graphs. . Visualizations and analysis by Adrian Turcato1 . .

We argue that the number of infected in the past can be inferred using today&#39;s number of deaths and average fatality rate from confirmed cases in the following way: . $$I_{t-j} = frac{D_t}{{CFR}_t}$$ . where $I_t$ = number of infected, $D_t$ = number of deaths, and ${CFR}_t $ = case fatality rate = $ frac{D}{C}$. The $j$ depends on the average number of days that covid patients die after having the first symptoms. . Assumption 1: The case fatality rate is a good proxy for the fatality rate of the infected population . Then, in order to estimate the current number of infected $I_t$ we need to estimate its growth rate from $t-j$ to $t$. . $$I_t = (1+ hat{g})^j I_{t-j}$$ . Assumption 2: The growth rate of infected $ hat{g}$ is an unbiased estimate of $g$ . . For now we estimate $g$ using the average growth rate since having the first infected person. . Assumption 3: It takes on average 8 days to die after having the first symptoms. . This analysis was conducted by Joao B. Duarte.

Appendix: Model Diagnostics . Derived relationship between Test Capacity and Case Under-reporting . Plotted is the estimated relationship between test capacity (in terms of people per test -- larger = less testing) and the likelihood a COVID-19 case is reported (lower = more under-reporting of cases). . The lines represent the posterior samples from our MCMC run (note the x-axis is plotted on a log scale). The rug plot shows the current test capacity for each state (black &#39;|&#39;) and the capacity one week ago (cyan &#39;+&#39;). For comparison, South Korea&#39;s testing capacity is currently at the very left of the graph (200 people per test). . About this Analysis . This analysis was done by Joseph Richards. . This project1 uses the testing rates per state from https://covidtracking.com/, which reports case counts and mortality by state. This is used to estimate the number of unreported (untested) COVID-19 cases in each U.S. state. . The analysis makes a few assumptions: . The probability that a case is reported by a state is a function of the number of tests run per person in that state. Hence the degree of under-reported cases is a function of tests run per capita. | The underlying mortality rate is the same across every state. | Patients take time to succumb to COVID-19, so the mortality counts today reflect the case counts 7 days ago. E.g., mortality rate = (cumulative deaths today) / (cumulative cases 7 days ago). | The model attempts to find the most likely relationship between state-wise test volume (per capita) and under-reporting, such that the true underlying mortality rates between the individual states are as similar as possible. The model simultaneously finds the most likely posterior distribution of mortality rates, the most likely true case count per state, and the test volume vs. case underreporting relationship. . . Full details about the model are available at: https://github.com/jwrichar/COVID19-mortality&#8617; . |",

This analysis was done by Thomas Wiecki. Interactive visualizations were created by Hamel Husain. . The model that we are building assumes exponential growth. This is definitely wrong because growth would just continue uninterrupted into the future. However, in the early phase of an epidemic it&#39;s a reasonable assumption.1 . We assume a negative binomial likelihood as we are dealing with count data. A Poisson could also be used but the negative binomial allows us to also model the variance separately to give more flexibility. . The model is also hierarchical, pooling information from individual countries. . .

Total case estimation calculated from deaths by: Assuming that unbiased fatality rate is 1.5% (from heavily tested countries / the cruise ship data) and that it takes 8 days on average for a case to go from being confirmed positive (after incubation + testing lag) to death. This is the same figure used by &quot;Estimating The Infected Population From Deaths&quot; in this repo. | Testing bias: the actual lagged fatality rate is than divided by the 1.5% figure to estimate the testing bias in a country. The estimated testing bias then multiplies the reported case numbers to estimate the true case numbers (=case numbers if testing coverage was as comprehensive as in the heavily tested countries). | The testing bias calculation is a high source of uncertainty in all these estimations and projections. Better source of testing bias (or just true case numbers), should make everything more accurate. | . | Projection is done using a simple SIR model with (see examples) combined with the approach in Total Outstanding Cases: Growth rate calculated over the 5 past days. This is pessimistic - because it includes the testing rate growth rate as well, and is slow to react to both improvements in test coverage and &quot;flattening&quot; due to social isolation. | Recovery probability being 1/20 (for 20 days to recover) where the rate estimated from Total Outstanding Cases is too high (on down-slopes). | . | ICU need is calculated as being 6% of active cases where: Active cases are taken from the SIR model. | This is both pessimistic - because real ICU rate may in reality be lower, due to testing biases, and especially in &quot;younger&quot; populations), and optimistic - because active cases which are on ICU take longer (so need the ICUs for longer). | ICU capacities are from Wikipedia (OECD countries mostly) and CCB capacities in Asia. | ICU spare capacity is based on 70% normal occupancy rate (66% in US, 75% OECD) | . | . . Examples of modeling plots . For the 5 countries with highest estimated number of new cases. . Note: The purpose of the below plots is to demonstrate the actual calculations used in the tables above and the dynamics of the model. .",

Do you have a visualization that you would like to add? Or would you like to improve or fix an existing visualization? . Please see the Contributing Guide. . You can also get in touch if you have any questions. . Background . This project is supported by a virtual team of open source collaborators that gather data, make visualizations, and perform analysis regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. We saw that data scientists were struggling to share information with each other, so we used this project to aid in the sharing of data and information. This project aims to offer an accessible way for data professionals to share dashboards (that are updated with new data automatically) without requiring any expertise in front-end development. . . Familiarity with fastpages is helpful. All you need to do is include the appropriate front matter in your notebook. You can submit a pull request at github.com/github/covid19-dashboard. &#8617; . |",
